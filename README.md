# An analysis of the acoustic signature of looms

This repository consists of the analysis of the 3 distinctive looms of the Mus√©e de la Soierie de Charlieu, France. We will start by analyzing the time domain signature of the fly-shuttle in order to determine the picks per minute (ppm) produced by the loom and focus on the evolution of noise exposure related to the weaving process by measuring the noise and the frequency components of the respective looms.

## Prerequisites

- numpy (to implement fft)
- scipy (to find peaks)
- matplotlib (for graphing)
- pandas (to manipulate noise measurements data)
- librosa (to load audio file)
- IPython.display (to listen to audio file)
